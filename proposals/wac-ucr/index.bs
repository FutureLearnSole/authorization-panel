Introduction {#intro}
================================================================================

The [[#usecases]] in this document represent real-world scenarios that
Web Access Control can and should support. The [[#requirements]] in this
document are derived from those use cases, and inform the contents of the
Web Access Control specification.

Requirements {#requirements}
================================================================================

Issue: Populate requirements based on established use cases.

## Example Category ## {#example-category}

### This is an example requirement ### {#example-requirement}

Assert: Related Use Cases: [[#uc-basic]]

Use Cases {#usecases}
================================================================================

For the purposes of simplicity, the use cases herein assume that named
individuals (i.e. Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.) are already
[=authenticated agents=], and their corresponding [=identities=] are known
by the [=resource controller=] when they are granted access.

## Basic resource access ## {#uc-basic}

Alice has a private draft of her resume stored on her [=resource server=] at
`https://alice.example/resume`. Alice is the [=resource controller=]
for that resource.

<figure>
<figcaption>Alice's resume and recommendations resources at https://alice.example</figcaption>
  <table class="data collections" align="left">
    <col>
    <col>
    <col>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Resource</th>
        <th scope="col">Type</th>
        <th scope="col">Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>`/resume`</td>
        <td>Single Resource</td>
        <td>Alice's curriculum vitae</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`/recommendations`</td>
        <td>Single Resource</td>
        <td>Recommendations for Alice</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>

### Control access ### {#basic-control}

Alice asks Bob to help make her resume more presentable. Alice must give
Bob permission to do this, because `resume` is not a public resource, and
as the [=resource controller=] Alice is the only one who can manage
permissions for it.

### Read-write access ### {#basic-write}

Alice gives Bob [=read access=] so that he can read the `resume` resource,
and [=write access=] so that he can make changes to it, which he does.

### Read-append access ### {#basic-readappend}

Danielle agrees to give Alice a personal reference, which Alice will
include in the references section of `resume`.
Alice gives Danielle [=read access=] to `resume` for context, and
[=append access=] so that she can only add new data to `resume`, and
cannot change any existing data within it. Danielle adds a glowing
reference for Alice to `resume`.

### Append-only access ### {#basic-appendonly}

Alice is interested in seeing whether any of her other contacts might
provide good recommendations that she can include as additional references
or a resume cover letter.

She creates a `recommendations` resource, and grants [=append access=] to the
`contacts` [=authorization group=], which represents every professional
contact in her virtual rolodex. She sends a mass-mail to `contacts`,
with a link to an app they can use to submit a recommendation, which will be
appended to `recommendations`. Since they only have [=append access=],
and no [=read access=], they can only add to that `recommendations`, they
cannot see recommendations that have already been added.

### Removing access ### {#basic-removing}

Alice removes Bob and Danielle's access to `resume`, since they've both
finished contributing to it. They can no longer read or make changes to it.

### Read only access ### {#basic-readonly}

Alice has a job interview with Carol. Alice gives Carol [=read access=]
to `resume` ahead of the interview.

### Group access ### {#basic-group}

Alice has additional interest, and is now interviewing with people from
multiple organizations, including Carol, Oscar, and Frank.

To make it easier to keep track of everyone,
Alice creates an `interviewing` [=authorization group=] and adds Carol,
Oscar, and Frank to it. She grants [=read access=] on `resume` to the
`interviewing` [=authorization group=].

Alice removes any individual permissions on `resume` that were granted
to members of the `interviewing` [=authorization group=]
since they are no longer necessary.

Now Alice can add new people she's interviewing with to the `interviewing`
[=authorization group=], and remove them when the
opportunity is no longer active. This is much more intuitive and
easy for Alice.

### Public access ### {#basic-public}

Alice decides `resume` is ready to share with everyone, so she gives
[=read access=] to the public (everyone), and shares a link to it on several
job boards.

## Basic collection access ## {#uc-collections}

Note: These use cases are focused on access to the collection itself. Use
cases that focus on permissions related to resouces within the collection
are covered in [[#uc-inheritance]].

Alice has a project portfolio stored on the Web at
`https://alice.example/portfolio`
that she is able to furnish materials from as needed as she moves
through a job interview process.

Her portfolio includes individual documents that she's produced, and
collections of deliverables from projects that she's worked on.

### Read-only access to a Collection ### {#collection-readonly}

Alice has identified a select group of companies that she'd like to
interview with for a new job.

Alice has identified several companies that she'd like to work for,
as well as the specific people to contact at each one; Carol, Oscar,
and Frank.

Alice sends individual e-mails to Carol, Oscar, and Frank with links to her
resume and portfolio.

Alice has granted Carol, Oscar, and Frank read access to her resume which
allows them to read its contents fully.

Alice has also granted them read access to the portfolio resource, which
is a collection. She only wants them to see detail about the portfolio
collection itself, and a listing of its contents, but not the contents of
the resources within it yet.

She wants to know which of them are really interested based on who
asks her for more access to the portfolio contents.

### Read-write access to a Collection ### {#collection-readwrite}

Alice worked in the past with Milo, and they produced a document
which she has included in her portfolio; `/portfolio/document1`.

Alice realized that she doesn't have the most up-to-date version of the
document, and needs Milo to replace it. She gives Milo read access and
write access to her portfolio collection itself, which allows him to
see the listing of its contents, as well as add and remove items from it.
He cannot read the contents of any of the resources in the collection,
but this is fine, since he knows the name of the resource he's replacing.

Milo deletes `/portfolio/document1`, and replaces it with an updated
version at `/portfolio/document1`.

### Read-append access to a Collection ### {#collection-readappend}

Alice worked with Bob in the past on a project, and she stored the
resulting deliverables she had in the `/portfolio/project1` collection.
She's sure that she's missing some, and that Bob would have the missing
items.

Alice grants Bob read access and append access to the `project1` collection,
which allows him to see the list of what is there, and add new items to it.
He can't see the contents of the items, or remove anything in the list.
That's fine because he only needs to add the items that aren't included.

### Append-only access to a Collection ### {#collection-appendonly}

Alice realizes it would be helpful if Carol, Oscar, and Frank could
provide her with job opportunities that they think she would be a fit for
at their respective organizations.

She provides them with append access to the `/opportunities` collection.
This allows each of them to add new resources, without the ability to see
the listing of other resources in the collection, or modify them. This means
that they can each add descriptions, but none of the others will see them.

### Control access to a Collection ### {#collection-control}

Bob reminds Alice that some of the other people who worked on `project1`
may also have materials they can add to her portfolio, but needs to
lookup their information.

Alice trusts Bob with the contents of the `project1` collection, since its
the output of their shared work. She gives him `control` permission
so that he can help her invite some of their other past colleagues to
add resources to it.

## Inheritance ## {#uc-inheritance}

Bob is leading a group of colleagues doing field research. The group
includes Charles, Felicia, Juan, and Irene.

The group uses a data library for storing their information at
`https://research.example/library`, which Bob administers. Bob has full
control over data authorizations.

Bob created an authorization group called `research`, and added Charles,
Felicia, Juan, and Irene.

### Read-only access to collection of resources ### {#inheritance-readonly}

Bob has a weekly status meeting with the `research` group.

Bob is a diligent notetaker, which his colleagues appreciate. He's happy
to share his notes with them, but doesn't want the overhead of granting
them permissions every week to each newly created note.

Bob stores his notes from the weekly status meeting in the
`/data/weekly-status` collection.

He grants the `research` group inherited read access
to the `/data/weekly-status` collection, which means they can read specific
details about the collection, see a listing of it contents
(e.g. Bob's notes), and read the contents of each note. This is especially
important because each Note is actually a collection, capable of storing
inline data or attachments like pictures and audio/video media.

Because the read access is set at the collection and inherited, it will apply
to everything already in the collection, as well as anything that will be
added in the future.

### Read-append access to collection resources ### {#inheritance-readappend}

Every day, someone in the group is responsible for recording data from
devices in the field, and storing those metrics in `/data/daily-metrics`.

Bob gives the `research` authorization group inherited append access to the
`/data/daily-metrics` collection. This allows anyone in the group to
see the contents of the collection, and add readings. They cannot modify
readings after they are recorded to provide confidence that
readings are not manipulated after the fact.

### Read-write access to collection resources ### {#inheritance-readwrite}

The members of the `research` group work together on a daily summary where
they analyze the field readings stored in `/data/daily-summaries`, and
detail any new, validated, or invalidated hypotheses.

Bob gives the `research` group inherited read access and write access to the
`/data/daily-summaries` collection. This allows anyone in the group to
see the contents of the collection and collaborate on a given day's summary,
updating the contents together until they're satisfied with the results.

### Append-only access to collection resources ### {#inheritance-appendonly}

Bob purchases a new field device that is able to automatically push data
into daily metric readings in `/data/daily-metrics`.

Bob gives the field device read access on the `/data/daily-metrics` so it
can access the list of resources inside, and inherited append access to
`/data/daily-metrics`, which allows it to add to a daily-metric resource if it
already exists, or create a new one if the `research` group hasn't made
one for the day yet.

### Control access to collection resources ### {#inheritance-control}

Bob realizes that he needs some help administering the data library. He
provides Carol with inherited control access to the research data library
at `/data`, allowing her to manage permissions for all of the resources
and collections included within it.

### Default permissions on created resources ### {#inheritance-defaultcreated}

Since Bob is granting inherited permissions to the `research` group at
the collection level for `/data/daily-summaries` and `/data/daily-metrics`
that include the ability to add resources (write / append), it's important
that the resources they create have the correct permissions assigned
automatically, and he needs to be able to ensure this when he
sets up their access. Otherwise, how can he be sure that the files
aren't created with access that too liberal (e.g. public access), or too
narrow to be usable within their context?

Bob prefers that any resources created echo the permissions that whoever
created that resource had, but in certain circumstances, he'd like to be
able to specify this in more granular fashion.

### Adding new subjects to inherited permissions ### {#inheritance-adding}

Note: Adding a new authorization subject means we are adding a new person /
group / application to the collection that isn't already part of an
inherited rule. Modifying permissions for these kinds of subjects is
covered in [[#inheritance-modifying]].

Bob has given inherited read-access to the weekly-status collection,
to the `research` group, outlined in [[#inheritance-readonly]].

Celeste isn't a regular member of the `research` group but happened
to join a weekly status meeting on December 30th, 2019.

Bob would like to give Celesete inherited read access to **only** the
Note for the meeting she attended `12-30-2019.note`,
without affecting the access that he's given to the `research` group,
who have inherited read access on everything in `/data/weekly-status`, and
anything that is added to it.

Effective access to `12-30-2019.note` should be that `Celeste` and the
members of the `research` group have inherited read access. `Celeste` has
no other access to other resources in the `weekly-status` collection, nor any
that will be created later. The access for the `research` group doesn't change.

### Modifying inherited permissions for existing subjects ### {#inheritance-modifying}

On the January 6th weekly status meeting, the Bob and the `research` group
covered a research topic related to a commercial endeavor that Felicia is
involved in. When Felicia saw this on the agenda, she informed Bob that
it would be a conflict of interest for her to participate in the discussion.
To ensure that there would be no semblance of conflict or impropriety,
Bob and Felicia agreed that he would remove her access to the meetings
notes for that session at `/data/weekly-status/01-06-2020.note`.

Effective access to `/data/weekly-status/01-06-2020.note` then becomes
the inherited read access to the `research group` (which Felicia is part of),
minus Felicia. Felicia continues to have inherited read access to all other
existing resources in the `/data/weekly-status` collection, and any new
resources added to it. Access for others in the `research` group (inherited
read access) is unchanged.

### Forcing inherited permissions ### {#inheritance-forcing}

As the primary administrator of the data library, Bob wants to ensure that
he maintains ultimate control over the data inside. Even though he's given
Carol permission to help him administer the system, he wants to ensure
that she's not able to cut out his access, and that he's always in a position
to maintain a minimum of read access and control access to all of the resources
in the data library. This allows him to have visibility into
ever resource, and change their permissions as needed.

## Conditional access ## {#uc-conditional}

Felicia works for an organization that conducts clinical trials, and
leads a team that processes and synthesizes incoming data from
trial participants of the `Acme` trial.

Felicia administers the
data repository for the `Acme` trial as part of her responsibilities,
which includes managing authorized access to that data repository for
her colleagues, and a group of research interns.

### Conditional access by time ### {#conditional-time}

Erin is a research intern that will be assisting Felicia's team in processing
and synthesizing data for the `Acme` trial. She will remain on the team
until the end of her current academic term on June 30th, 2020.

Felicia has granted Erin inherited read access and write access to the
`/measurements` collection, which contains measurements for all trial
participants across all trials.

Felicia adds an expiration condition to all of Erin's authorization grants
on the to allows them to remain valid only through June 30th, 2020.

### Conditional access by tag ### {#conditional-tag}

As a research intern, Erin is responsible for processing all unprocessed
measurements for the `Acme` trial in `/measurements`. However, there
are measurements for other trials in that collection, as well as measurements
that have already been processed.

* Each measurement in `measurements` is tagged with the trial it belongs to
* All measurements for the `Acme` trial are tagged with `Acme`
* When a new measurement is processed, it is tagged as `processed`

Felicia authorizes Erin to have inherited read access and write access to
`/measurements`, with the condition that the resources must:

* **include** the `Acme` tag
* **exclude** the `processed` tag

This allows Erin to work with new measurements for the `Acme` trial without
being exposed to measurements from other trials, or already processed
measurements from the `Acme` trial.

### Conditional access by filter ### {#conditional-filter}

Felicia has been able to limit the scope of the resources that Erin
can access to unprocessed entries for the `Acme` trial, which is all that
she needs to perform her duties. However, each measurement resource also
contains PII for the trial participant associated with the measurement.
Felicia needs to ensure that Erin cannot access that PII.

Felicia authorizes Erin to access a reduced set of fields within the
measurement resources. When Erin retrieves a measurement record, the
response will exclude the fields containing PII.


## Permissioning Applications ## {#uc-applications}

Oscar has financial data and health data stored at `https://oscar.example/`.

* Oscar uses `FinanceApp` to manage his financial data.
* Oscar uses `HealthApp` to manage his health data.

Notwithstanding his trusted applications that help him manage his data
and access to it, Oscar wants to explicitly specify that only `FinanceApp`
can be used with his credentials to access his financial data, and only
`HealthApp` can be used to access his health data.

## Privacy ## {#uc-privacy}

### Limiting access to who else is permitted ### {#uc-whopermitted}

Alice is interviewing for a job with Carol. Alice is also interviewing for a
job with Oscar, Carol's direct competitor.

Alice has given Carol and Oscar read access to her resume.

Neither Carol or Oscar would appreciate knowing that Alice is interviewing
with both of them, so it's important neither Carol or Oscar know who
Alice has shared her resume with, despite having read access to it.

### Limiting access to other authorization conditions ### {#uc-historyofchanges}

As an extension of [[#uc-whopermitted]], it is also important to Alice that
that neither Carol nor Oscar be able to discern other characteristics of
the authorization rules or conditions associated with them. For example,
if the data Carol and Oscar saw in the resume was
[[#conditional-filter|filtered]] to only show a certain subset of her
background, she wouldn't want them to know that.

## Trust ## {#uc-trust}

### Only trust certain issuers of identity ### {#uc-trustedissuers}

Carol has a blog, and allows anyone with an authenticated web identity
(e.g. [[WEBID]], [[DID]]) to comment on her blog posts.

Unfortunately, anyone can setup an identity provider, so Carol would
like to be able to recognize credentials issued from trustworthy
identity providers.

## Validation ## {#uc-validation}

Juan likes to manage his authorization statements manually. Every
once in a while, Juan makes a typo, or accidentally saves the resource
in an incomplete state.

When this happens to Juan on systems where the Web Access Control
implementation doesn't have proper validation, he often runs into trouble,
most often by getting locked out of the resource and required administrator
assistance to recover.

## Capabilities ## {#uc-capabilities}

### Possession of a verifiable credential ### {#capabilities-vc}

Oscar has a medical condition that causes random and very serious
seizures several times per year. Wherever Oscar is, he needs to be
rushed immediately to the closest hospital in an ambulance.

Oscar's government has recently rolled out a digital credential system
for health care professionals, which is like a digital id card for
doctors and care facilities that can be cryptographically verified.

Oscar has an emergency care record at `https://oscar.example/emergency`, and
Oscar's authorization system at `https://oscar.example` supports a
verifiable credential authorization capability.

Oscar has set permissions on `https://oscar.example/emergency` that grants
someone in possession of a verifiable medical credential to have inherited
read access to the contents. This gives them just enough background on
his condition to treat him properly.

### Possession of a link ### {#capabilities-link}

Bob is about to give a confidential presentation to a group of his
colleagues. His presentation is stored on his private server at
`https://bob.example/presentation`.

Bob is having trouble hooking his laptop up to the projector, and
needs to present in just a few minutes. Anne presented before Bob,
and offers to bring the presentation up for him on her system.

Unfortunately, Anne doesn't have an identity ready to go that he can
xauthorization. Luckily, his authorization system supports a link-based
authorization capability.

Bob quickly creates an authorization rule for `https://bob.example/presentation`
that allows anyone in possession of a specially generated link to access
the document with read-only permissions. He sets it to
[[#conditional-time|expire]] in three hours. Bob gives the link to Anne
and the presentation goes off perfectly.

Definitions {#definitions}
================================================================================

All definitions as stated below should be considered in the context of
Web Access Control, whether explicitly stated or not.

An <dfn>agent</dfn> is a distinct individual, group, organization, or piece
of software with an [=identity=] that can be strongly authenticated.

An <dfn>identity</dfn> is used to uniquely identify a given [=agent=],
represented by a unique [[URI]]. Examples of compatible identity systems
include [[WEBID]] and [[DID]].

An <dfn>authenticated agent</dfn> is an [=agent=] that can prove control
of a given [=identity=].

An <dfn>application</dfn> is a piece of software that interfaces with a
[=resource server=], which may operate autonomously as an
[=authenticated agent=], or in piloted-fashion by another
[=authenticated agent=].

An <dfn>application identity</dfn> is used to uniquely identify a given
[=application=], represented by a unique [[URI]].

A <dfn>resource controller</dfn> is an [=agent=] with fully permissioned
access and control over one or more [=resources=] residing on a
[=resource server=] on the Web.

A <dfn>resource server</dfn> is a web server that provides an
interface to make [=resources=] available to [=agents=] and [=applications=],
with the ability to secure access to those [=resources=]
through associated [=acl resources=].

A <dfn>resource</dfn> is the target of an HTTP request identified by a [[URI]],
as defined in [[!RFC7231]].

A <dfn>collection</dfn> is a [=resource=] that is representative of a set
of other [=resources=], which may include other [=collections=].

An <dfn>acl resource</dfn> is a [=resource=] that includes one or more
[=authorization statements=] applied to one or more [=resources=].

An <dfn>authorization statement</dfn> is an expression included in
an [=acl resource=] that identfies permitted [=access modes=] to
[=authorization targets=] by [=authorization subjects=].

An <dfn>authorization subject</dfn> identifies the [=agent=] and/or
[=application=] that a given [=authorization statement=] applies to.

An <dfn>authorization target</dfn> identifies the resources that a given
[=authorization statement=] applies to.

An <dfn>authorization group</dfn> is a [=resource=] including
any combination of discrete [=authorization subjects=] and
[=authorization groups=], which can be included in an
[=authorization statement=] as an [=authorization subject=].

An <dfn>authorization condition</dfn> provides additional criteria
to be used in the evaluation of an [=authorization statement=], beyond
the [=authorization subject=], [=authorization target=], and [=access modes=].


An <dfn>access mode</dfn> denotes a class of operations that an
[=authorization subject=] can perform on an [=authorization target=] in an
[=authorization statement=].

<dfn>Read access</dfn> is an [=access mode=] that allows the
[=authorization subject=] to the ability to read, but not modify, the
[=authorization target=].

<dfn>Write access</dfn> is an [=access mode=] that allows the
[=authorization subject=] to the ability to create, update, or delete the
[=authorization target=].

<dfn>Append access</dfn> is an [=access mode=] that allows the
[=authorization subject=] to add data to a resource, but not modify any
data that already exists.
[=authorization target=].

<dfn>Control access</dfn> is an [=access mode=] that allows the
[=authorization subject=] to view and modify [=acl resources=] associated
with an [=authorization target=].
